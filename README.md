# encrypt-c

I was included in an email asking if anyone would be able to me this fairly simple plugin
as a way of making it more difficult for users to mess up sending and encrypted email from Outlook.

Although I've been wanting to, I haven't actually use C# at all, so I'm going off of C/C++,
which I haven't really used in years.  All things considered, I'm happy I was able to
make it work pretty quickly.
